# 🧪 ASP.NET Core – My Practice Projects (.NET 9)

This repository contains my personal ASP.NET Core exercises built with .NET 9.  
I'm currently learning the basics — experimenting with minimal APIs, request/response handling and simple routing.

---

## 📁 What's Inside

- `RequestResponseDemo` – a basic project to test how endpoints work and how to return responses

More projects will be added as I continue learning.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) installed.

Then run:

```bash
cd AspNetCoreExercises/RequestResponseDemo
dotnet run
```

The app runs on:

```
http://localhost:5256/
```

Try endpoints like `/hello`, `/time`, `/request`.
